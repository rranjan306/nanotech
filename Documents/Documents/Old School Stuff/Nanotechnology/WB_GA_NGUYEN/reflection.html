		<h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>When I was first assigned the Bio Expo project in genetics class, way back in October, I was extremely excited. Unlike the science fairs I had participated in during middle school, I really wanted to give this project my all. The whole conept seemed different and more challenging. There was such a wide selection of categories that, at first, I didn’t know which one to choose. I hadn’t wanted to do a lot of writing, however, because I felt that I already did too much writing in school. By January, I had narrowed the categories down to two: a website or artwork. Art seemed like a fun idea, but when I couldn’t come up with any ideas for an engaging piece of art, I turned to the website. </p>
        <p>My inspiration for this project came from the fact that I am on the internet almost everyday, and I believe that it is one of the best ways to reach people. Before I began researching nanotechnology, like many of my peers, I had no idea what it was. The only "nano" I knew of was the mp3 player. After pouring in effort to create this, I am extremely happy that I had chosen an unknown as my topic. I have had the chance to research an interesting field that will affect society for many years to come, and through this project, I have found that technology revolutionizes the way we live, even in its smallest forms. </p>
        <p>This has been a very challenging project for me because when I first started out, I had little to no knowledge of html, and I couldn’t get things to look exactly the way I wanted them to. However, I have overcome most of those challenges with help from friends and helpful online guides, and the end result is right here on this computer monitor!</p>
        <h4>Special Acknowledgments</h4>
        <p>It has been a very long journey to finishing this project, so I would like to take some time to thank the people who helped me throughout this whole process.</p> 
        <p>First of all, a thank you to my science teacher, <b><font id="bullet">Ms. Agatsuma</font></b>, who encouraged me from the beginning and helped me to choose a topic- she put this whole project in motion.</p>
        <p>I would also like to express my gratitude to my mentor, <b><font id="bullet">Laura Burke</font></b>, for giving me ideas to help me get started. Thanks also for taking the time to look over my rough drafts. </p>
        <p>Shout out to <b><font id="bullet">Steven</font></b> and <b><font id="bullet">Mandy</font></b>, for providing me with moral and technical support! </p>
        <p>A special mention is needed for <b><font id="bullet">dynamicdrive.com</font></b>, the website that provided me with my navigation bar. After countless hours of trying to create one myself, I finally turned to the experts. </p>
        <p>Last, but not least, I would like to thank my <b><font id="bullet">family</font></b>, who stayed patient with me while I had my eyes glued to the computer.</p>
